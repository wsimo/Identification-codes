By training the CNN (convolutional neural network) to identify 4-digit captchas, there are a total of 62 characters in 0-9a-zA-Z characters, but the prediction results are case-insensitive, so the final prediction result is 36. The verification code is randomly generated by multiple fonts, colors, and interference lines.
